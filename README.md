## Folder Structure
Here is the core folder structure which flutter provides.

```
flutter-app/
|- android
|- assets
|- build
|- ios
|- lib
|- test
|- web
```

Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project

```
lib/app
|- data/
|- modules/
|- routes.dart
```

Now, lets dive into the lib folder which has the main code for the application.

```
1- constants - All the application level constants are defined in this directory with-in their respective files. This directory contains the constants for `theme`, `api endpoints`, `preferences` etc.
2- modules - Contains the 3 different modules of the app. 
3 - routes.dart‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThis file contains all the routes for your application.
```

### Constants

This directory contains all the application level constants. A separate file is created for each type as shown in example below:

```
constants/
|- alerts.dart
|- end_points.dart
|- images.dart
|- stylings.dart
```

### Modules

Contains the 3 different modules of the appplication.

```
modules/
|- history/
|- home/
|- questions
```
Folders found in each module:

```
controllers - this is where the logic of the app is written.
views - contains the ui of the module. 
providers‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcontains the network calls.
models - contains the application's dynamic data structure
```



### Routes

```
